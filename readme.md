A set of functions to help using winget.

Entirely written in __Powershell__, it has 2 types of functions : visuals and non visuals.

No dependencies are used to ensure compatibility with Powershell 5.1

***
## Remaks :
  The goal of this module is not really the same as *Microsoft.WinGet.Client* 

  Basically, it was focused on the "graphical interface" aspect. The "parsing" part was added naturally.
  Unlike the official module, it is 100% written in Powershell in order to be compatible with version 5.1 and requires NO external dependency.

  But, in the end, it offers the same functionalities, new ones will be added to it as time goes on. (Scoop support, .....)
***
The availablle functions are :
- Get-WGPackage [-source] [-interactive] [-uninstall] [-update] [-apply]
- Search-WGPackage [-package "search terms"] [-source "source"] [-interactive] [-install] [-allowsearch]
- Get-WGList [-source "source"]
- Get-WGSources
- Install-WGPackage [-package] [-source] [-silent] [-acceptpackageagreements] [acceptsourceagreements]
- Invoke-Winget 
- Out-Object              
- Show-WGList                 
- Uninstall-WGPackage  *(deprecated)*        
- Update-WGPackage [-Update]  *(deprecated)*
- Set-WingetposhConfig -param -value
- Get-WingetposhConfig [-display]
- Reset-WingetposhConfig
- Get-WGPVersions [-param]
- Build-WGInstallFile [-file]
  

Starting with version 1.0.0, **Scoop** (if present) is supported.
This is a limited support but it will grow with the next versions of WingetPosh.

When the module is imported for the first time, Scoop is detected and if present, his usage is flagged in the config file.

Scoop integration can be activated or deactivated with :
``` Powershell
  Set-WingetposhConfig -param includeScoop $True / $False
```
***
## Installation

``` Powershell
  Install-Module -Name wingetposh -Scope CurrentUser
```
# IMPORTANT 
Don't forget to import the module after the installation !
*Ideally, put it in your profile file ($PROFILE)*
When it's imported, the localized resources are downloaded from the winget repository.

### Remark : 
To install in powershell 5.1, you need to install the latest "PowershellGet"
``` Powershell
Install-Module PowerShellGet -AllowClobber -Force
```

Close and re-open the powershell 5.1 terminal to make changes effective.

Just as Search-WGPackage, Install-WGPackage now accept multiple search keys.  They must be comma-separated.

If no **-package** parameter is specified, the function will popup a window to enter the terms to search.

The source can be specified to limit the number of results.  EG : *-source winget*

## Building a config file to replicate packages installation

``` Powershell

But when confirmed with "Enter", the function will generate a JSON config file with every package informations.
This file can be used for future installation or replication of the same package list.
